 *
 * Given a binary tree
 *
 * ⁠   struct TreeLinkNode {
 * ⁠     TreeLinkNode *left;
 * ⁠     TreeLinkNode *right;
 * ⁠     TreeLinkNode *next;
 * ⁠   }
 *
 *
 *
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
 * next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the
 * same level, and every parent has two children).
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * For example,
 * Given the following perfect binary tree,
 *
 * ⁠        1
 * ⁠      /  \
 * ⁠     2    3
 * ⁠    / \  / \
 * ⁠   4  5  6  7
 *
 *
 *
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 *
 * ⁠        1 -> NULL
 * ⁠      /  \
 * ⁠     2 -> 3 -> NULL
 * ⁠    / \  / \
 * ⁠   4->5->6->7 -> NULL
