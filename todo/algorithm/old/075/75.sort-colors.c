 * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that
 * objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red,
 * white and blue.
 *
 *
 *
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red,
 * white, and blue respectively.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

 * A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting
 * sort.
 * First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then
 * overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
 * Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
