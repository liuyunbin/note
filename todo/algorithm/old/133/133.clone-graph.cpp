 *
 * Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a
 * list of its neighbors.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * OJ's undirected graph serialization:
 *
 *
 * Nodes are labeled uniquely.
 *
 *
 * We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label
 * and each neighbor of the node.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.
 *
 *
 *
 * The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as
 * separated by #.
 *
 * First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
 * Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
 * Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming
 * a self-cycle.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Visually, the graph looks like the following:
 *
 * ⁠      1
 * ⁠     / \
 * ⁠    /   \
 * ⁠   0 --- 2
 * ⁠        / \
 * ⁠        \_/
