 *
 * Some hints:
 *
 * Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
 *
 * If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the
 * restriction of using extra space.
 *
 * You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the
 * problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might
 * overflow. How would you handle such case?
 *
 * There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
